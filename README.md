Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Answer: 
Applying engineering principles systematically and tools to develop and maintain software products.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Answer:
 Software engineering involves the design, development, testing and maintenance of SOFTWARE PRODUCTS which are intangible while traditional programming involves development, testing and maintenance of PHYSICAL PRODUCTS such as vehicles.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Answer:
 - Planning – defining the project’s overall objective 
-	Requirements – collecting information on the system requirements and documenting it
-	Design – creating a detailed blueprint for the system
-	Implementation – writing the code to build the software
-	Testing – checking for defects and ensuring the software meets quality standards
-	Deployment – releasing the software to consumers
-	Maintenance – providing continuous support and enhancements to ensure the software functions properly


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Answer:  
                         comparison
-Both focus on delivering a high-quality software product
-Both have defined approaches whereby waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach while agile follows an iterative and incremental approach
-Both have methods of identifying, accessing and mitigating risks
	                    Contrast
-Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development whereas agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. 
- Waterfall model requirements are fixed and are expected not to change thus is inflexible when changes are made while agile model requirements evolve and are expected to change thus is highly flexible.
- Waterfall model has limited customer involvement and less frequent feedback while agile model depends on customer involvement and frequent feedback
	                    Key differences
-	Method of approach: waterfall model has a linear and sequential approach while agile model has an iterative and incremental approach
-	Customer involvement: waterfall model has limited customer involvement while agile model has continuous and frequent customer involvement
-	Flexibility: waterfall model is inflexible while agile model is highly flexible
                        Application scenarios
Agile model: can be suited in development of a Gaming Software where regular iterations are required to suit the players’ expectations such as Call of Duty Mobile which is updated on a monthly basis
Waterfall model: can be suited in development of microcontrollers for running the time in a digital wristwatch or a calculator such as Casio FX 991-EX


What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Answer:
               Definition: 
It’s the process of collecting, validating, documenting and managing requirements for a software system.
                process:
Inception – establishing a basic understanding of the problem, users and desired nature of solution
Elicitation – gathering the requirements from stakeholders, customers and users and what is to be accomplished
Elaboration – developing a refined requirements model that identifies the various aspects of software.
Negotiation – reconciling conflicts when users ask for more than can be achieved i.e. conflicting requirements.
Specification – documenting all the gathered requirements in a detailed manner such as applying graphical models where possible
Validation – accessing the work products produced during requirements engineering for quality
                Importance in SDLC: 
It ensures that all the needs and expectations of stakeholders are captured which will lead to reduced risks of misunderstandings, errors and costs during development and overall good quality and customer satisfaction


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Answer: 
Modularity involves breaking down the software system into self-contained components or modules whereby each module is developed independently and performs a specific task.  
Modularity improves maintainability since each module is developed independently thus changes can be done to an individual module with little impact to other modules
Modularity improves scalability because new modules can be added or modification can be done to existing modules easily without affecting entire system


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Answer:
            Levels of testing:
-	Unit testing – testing individual modules of a computer software
-	Integration testing – testing the interactions between different subsystems
-	System testing – testing the entire software
-	Acceptance testing – testing the software to check whether it meets end-user needs 
            importance:
Testing ensures bugs and defects are discovered and fixed to ensure reliability, quality and standards are met and customer satisfaction

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
Answer:
These are software tools for tracking and managing changes made to a source code and collaboration among team members such as Git. They also provide a means for backup and recovery


Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Answer:
                     Git
•	allows branching and merging
•	allows work to be done offline
•	its repositories are hosted in Github
•	has high speed and performance
•	tracks changes done on repository
                  Subversion
•	A central server stores history of the code
•	Tracks changes done on file
•	Allows administrators to set path based permissions
•	Set of changes to one or more files is done on a single commit
                        Mercurial 
•	Has a built-in web interface
•	Easy to use
•	Every developer has full copy of repository
•	It is fast and efficient
